# Portfolio Site

This repository contains my personal portfolio and utility app hub.  
It is built from scratch to publicly demonstrate architecture decisions, development workflow, and deployment practices.

The site currently serves as a foundation that will progressively showcase small, focused web utilities and engineering case studies.

---

## Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- Firebase Hosting
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

---

## Purpose

This project is intentionally built in the open to:

- demonstrate production-ready setup from day one
- maintain a visible commit history of engineering decisions
- host small, practical web utilities
- serve as a central hub for deployed projects

The site will evolve incrementally rather than launching fully built.

---

## Live Site

The production site is automatically deployed on every push to the `main` branch.
